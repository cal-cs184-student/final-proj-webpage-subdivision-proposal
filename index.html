        <h1>Implementation of Additional Subdivision Schemes</h1>
      </div>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we will be exploring additional subdivision schemes: the Butterfly scheme, the modified
        Butterfly scheme, Catmull-Clark scheme, the polar subdivision scheme, etc. We will compare the pros and cons
        for each of them, and discuss the tradeoffs when choosing a subdivision scheme under different scenarios.
      </p>

        <li>Julia Nicholson (julianicholson@berkeley.edu)</li>

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        Subdividing meshes is useful for rendering a more smooth, detailed surface. Subdivision methods allow us to take
        a coarse, simple mesh of an object and extrapolate from it to create more smooth edges. In Project 2, we
        implemented loop subdivision for triangle mesh surfaces. For our final project, our group will implement
        alternative methods of subdivision. Loop subdivision only works for triangle meshes, so meshes made from
        quadrilaterals require a different subdivision scheme, such as Catmull-Clark. Even for triangle meshes,
        different subdivision schemes have tradeoffs. Loop subdivision can yield smoother final surfaces, while
        Interpolating methods like the butterfly and modified butterfly method maintain key aspects of the original mesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenges of implementing different subdivision schemes lie in the details inherent to meshes: keeping
        track of vertices and edges within the mesh, creating new mesh elements only when necessary, and updating the
        mesh correctly with each subdivision. Our team plans to implement different options for subdivision (e.g.
        Butterfly, modified butterfly, Catmull-Clark, Doo-Sabin) to provide functionality and benefits of these
        different schemes.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <h3>What we plan to deliver</h3>
      <p>
        We plan to deliver images generated as a result of various subdivision algorithms. In order to have a successful
        project we will implement the different subdivision algorithms by assigning each person with one or two
        algorithms to split the work. This will ensure people have a similar amount of content to work on, and will get
        quicker to what we want to achieve. If we run into problems with implementing a specific subdivision algorithm,
        then we can research another different algorithm to implement instead. If our schedule is followed, then that is
        the baseline to complete our project satisfactorily.
      </p>

      <h3>What we hope to achieve</h3>
      <p>
        We hope to successfully implement several subdivisions algorithms such as butterfly, modified butterfly,
        catmull-clark, doo-sab, on different types of geometries and object meshes. If we finish before schedule, we
        will also try to implement polar subdivision and sharp edge support. Our results will either be a series of
        images showcasing the results of the different algorithms, or interactive 3D mesh models. Hopefully, there will
        be distinct differences that these algorithms have on objects such as basic geometric shapes, complex
        character/item models, sharp edges, and smooth curves. Furthermore, we will measure each algorithm’s speed and
        demonstrate the effectiveness of certain optimizations and modifications.

      <h3>Hardware Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Our project should be able to be compiled and executed on personal computers, by following the existing
        instructions of the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we will be using Berkeley instructional machines as our baseline. The hardware specs for hive machines
        are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770 CPU @ 3.40GHz</li>
        <li>32 GB Memory</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Software Resources</h3>
      <p>
        We will be using a working copy of project 2 from one of our team members as our starter code base. So we will
        be primarily using OpenGL APIs in our project.
